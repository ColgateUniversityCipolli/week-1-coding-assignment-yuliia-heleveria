  \begin{itemize}
  \item Use the \texttt{vrolik4} color palette. Note you can find other by running 
  \texttt{?colorPalette} in the console.
  \item Make the background grey. Note a hexcode for grey is \texttt{\#dbdbdb}.
  \item Specify that there should be 72 strands.
  \item Specify the angle used for bending the sequence for odd numbers as -0.05.
  \item Specify the angle used for bending the sequence for even numbers as 0.0145 
  (note this is the default).

\end{kframe}
\end{knitrout}
The solution is 4.
  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  % QUESTION 2e
  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \item Explain why this approach wouldn't work for something like $3^{x+2} + 5 (3^x) = 84$ where the solution is $x \approx 1.6309$.\\
\textbf{Solution:}

This approach would not work to find a solution $x$ which is not an integer, because the numeric vector created in step 2a contains only integers (numbers without any decimal value). However, in the example of the problem in 2e, the true solution has decimal value.
